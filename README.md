Intro to Big Data project.


#### To run the program:
Enter `python filterMain.py` into the command line in this folder. The program will give you a set of instructions from there. 


#### Notes: 
All DB code is in filter.py. Calling functions from filter.py will give return an array of `xAxis`, `yAxis` data points, _UNLESS_
it has school type (Public, Private, etc.) in it. In that case it will be an array of tuples, with format for each index being:
`( year , xAxis, yAxis)`. 

Any other questions just email me.
