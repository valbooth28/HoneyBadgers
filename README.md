### HoneyBadgers:
Intro to Big Data project created by Team Honey Badgers, featuring Mark Petrie, Val Booth, and Nick Jenis.

#### Overview:
This project was done for the Intro to Big Data class at RIT. Team Honey Badgers created a Windows Python App that allows you to filter and make graphs of three years worth of FAFSA dependency filing data representing every college/university in the US, along with outside territories. Data was retrieved from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=FAFSA&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc) and represents every quarter from Q1 2013 to Q3 2016.

##### Tech Stack:
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for the database
* [PyQT](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/) for generating graphs
* [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) for creating the standalone app.


#### To Use the App:
* Download zip file from [here](https://github.com/valbooth28/HoneyBadgers/blob/master/app_main.zip).
* Extract the folder named `app_main` from the `app_main.zip` file.
* Enter the folder and find the file `app_main.exe`.
* Double click the file to launch the application. You may receive a pop up that says, "The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?"	Please select the 'Run' option.
*	Wait a moment and the 'Plot' GUI window will open.
